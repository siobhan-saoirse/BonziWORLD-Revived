		<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
		<li>Q: Why are there non-bonzi colors?</li>
		<li>A: It's to provide users some characters that are optional. So if you see a Touhou-like character or a Microsoft Agent character, it's not going to slow the website down. It actually depends on your device peformance.</li>
		<br>
		<li>Q: What happened to BWR in the last 2 years?</li>
		<li>A: Well, there was a time that I always responded to trolls, and a teen (who now has a job) used to ruin my reputation in order to get more members on his competiting server. No joke. Frankly, I don't even do that anymore. I'm all grown up, so an insult won't get my attention.</li>
		<br>
		<li>Q: Who made this?</li>
		<li>A: Siobhan made this server.</li>
		<br>
		<li>Q: Are there any mods?</li>
		<li>A: Yeah, but they are essentially powerless and limited to only a few commands that rely on their runlevel.<br>They used to be able to nuke or kick users but I've since then given that ability to kern due to complaints of abuse.<br>If you see a user with a green name, that's a moderator.</li>
		<br>
		<li>Q: Are you going to hire any mods?</li>
		<li>A: I can, but It's mostly directed towards my friends and DonutScout, the server maintainer of this website.</li>
		<br>
		<li>Q: Who is "Siobhan"?</li>
		<li>A: Siobhan <font size="-4">(she/her)</font> is the owner of this website, She was formerly named "Seamus" until her online transition in 2024. She is fine if people refer her as her birth name, as her parents still refer her as that name.</li>
		<br>
		<li>Q: Isn't siobhan a pedo?</li>
		<li>A: lol no<br>
		TL;DR: That is just a result of overexaggeration by my old friends who seem to get angry so easily.<br>
	 	In fact, The whole situation is heavily misunderstood.<br>
		The incident started due to Niko's lack of knowledge of the risks of letting something happen. In the screenshot below, Back when I STILL acted like a kid who barely knew how bad it could get, Niko said I could post it if I wanted to.<br>
		<img src="https://files.catbox.moe/n5t6hf.webp" width="240"><br>
		"miracle machine" was previously Niko's alt which was used to reenact her own past, but is now used as an emergency alter-ego.
		<br>
		We both regret making this decision and have since then learned from this big mistake we made. The pedophile named Glitch56 is to blame since he started the freaky shit in our friend group.<br>Before you say i'm blaming it on Niko, I'm not. Niko herself said she started it, Plus, Glitch56 was being 'freaky' at the time.</li>
